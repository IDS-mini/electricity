# Electricity Usage Optimizer

## For whom?

Do you have an an hourly rate on your electricity? Do you have a house with electrical heating or an electric car, perhaps? Are you worried about your coming electric bills? In that case, let us introduce you to the Electricity Usage Optimizer.

## What?

The Electricity Usage Optimizer give you glance to the near future of electrical prices. 

The market price hourly rates are given one day ahead but you don't have to charge your car every day. That is why give you foresight on three upcoming days. When are the cheapest hours probably coming? Or the most expensive ones?

The Electricity Usage Optimizer gives you simple, three-step recommendations on how to manage your consumption during the coming days. We give you no misleading price figures, no calculations, no IoT gadgets or mobile apps needed, no hard-to-read graphs. Just one pageload.

## Why?

Because when you have a rough grasp of the coming days, you can advance or postpone your costly actions and thus save some actual money.

But that is not all!

During these difficult times, when prices reach record-levels, reducing peak-hour consumption benefits **the whole society**. When the capacity of power production is at its limits, and the demand is high, every new marginal unit of production costs **way more** than it would during the calm hours. Prices go very steeply up when the demand is high.

Now that also means that the prices come rapidly down. Our ability to do even moderate adaptation during the bottleneck periods have a considerable effect on prices. So by optimizing your consumption you will help everyone else too!

## Summary:

So to summarize, for you as a consumer with hourly electricity rates, our three main arguments are:

1. By planning and organizing your most power-consuming activites you can save money!
2. And by planning you will help everyone else, too. Every saved (or shifted) unit of consumption counts!
3. We give you a one-glance, easy-to-comprehend view for the coming days. No mobile apps, no calculations, no IoT humbug needed!
