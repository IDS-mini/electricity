# Electricity Usage Optimizer

## For whom?

Do you have an an hourly rate on your electricity? Do you have a house with electrical heating or an electric car, perhaps? Are you worried about your coming electric bills? In that case, let us introduce you to the Electricity Usage Optimizer.

## What?

The Electricity Usage Optimizer give you glance to the near future of electrical prices. 

The hourly rates are given one day ahead. We, however, give you foresight on three upcoming days. When are probably the cheapest hours coming? Or the most expensive ones?

The Electricity Usage Optimizer gives you a plain, three-step recommendations how to manage your consumption during the coming days. No misleading price figures, calculations, IoT gadgets, mobile apps or hard-to-read graphs. Just one pageload.

And when you have a rough grasp of the coming days, you can advance or postpone your costly actions and save money.

But that is not all!

During these difficult times, reducting peak-hour consumption benefits **the whole society**. When the capacity is at its limits and demand is high, every new marginal unit of production costs **way more**. Prices go steeply up when the demand is high.

Now this means that the prices come steeply down even if some electricity saving can be done. So by optimizing your consumption you will help everyone else too!

Our three main arguments are:

1. By planning and organizing your most power-consuming activites you can save money!
2. Your planning helps the whole society as prices increase and drop faster. Every saved (or shifted) unit of consumption counts!
3. You will have one-glance view for the next days. No mobile apps, no calculations, no IoT humbug needed!
