# Electricity Usage Optimizer

## For whom?

Do you have an an hourly rate on your electricity? Do you have a house with electrical heating or an electric car, perhaps? Are you worried about your coming electric bills? In that case, let us introduce you to the Electricity Usage Optimizer.

## What?

Now, normally you would get the hourly rates one day ahead. But you don't have to charge your car every day. Is the price cheaper on the day after tomorrow? 

The Electricity Usage Optimizer gives you a glance to the three upcoming days. It tells you when the cheapest stretches are coming - or the most expensive ones. 

We give you a simple, three-step recommendations on how to manage your consumption during the coming days. We give you no misleading price figures, no calculations. And best of all, no IoT gadgets or mobile apps needed. 

Just one pageload.

## Why?

When you have a rough grasp of the coming days, you can advance or postpone your costly actions thus saving some actual money.

But that is not all!

During these difficult times, when the prices reach record-levels, reducing peak-hour consumption benefits **the whole society**. When the capacity of power production is at its limits, and the demand is high, every new marginal unit of production costs **way more** than it would during the calm hours. Prices go very steeply up when the already high demand increases.

Now that also means that the prices come rapidly down. Our ability to do even moderate adaptation during the bottleneck periods have a considerable effect on the prices. So by optimizing your consumption you will help everyone else too.

## Summary

So, for you as a consumer with hourly electricity rates, our three main arguments are:

1. By planning and organizing your most power-consuming activites you can save real money!
2. And by planning you will help everyone else, too. Every saved (or shifted) unit of consumption counts!
3. We give you a one-glance, easy-to-comprehend view for the coming days. No mobile apps, no calculations, no IoT humbug needed!
